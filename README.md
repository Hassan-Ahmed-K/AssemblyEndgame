# Assembly Endgame

**Assembly Endgame** is an interactive word-guessing game built using **React 19**. The objective of the game is to guess the correct word within 8 attempts. Each incorrect guess causes a language to "die" on the screen, representing your diminishing chances. Can you save the languages and win the game?
